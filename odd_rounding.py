Problem:

    Professor Odd has developed a very odd system of rounding numbers.
    
    Like normal rounding, when rounding to the nearest 10 or 100, he looks at
    the next digit. However, in odd_rounding, if it is zero or odd, he'll round
    down. If it is bigger than zero and even he'll round up.

    Example:

    573 rounded to the nearest 10 is 570, because 3 is odd.
    429 rounded to the nearest 100 is 500, because 2 is even.
    390 rounded to the nearest 10 is 390, because it ends in 0.

    The function odd_rounding takes two numbers: the number to be rounded,
    and what we want to round to.  
    We will only round to 10 or 100 for the purposes of this problem, but try
    and find a general solution for any power of 10.

Tests:

    >>> odd_rounding(573, 10)
    570
    >>> odd_rounding(572, 10)
    580
    >>> odd_rounding(573, 100)
    500
    >>> odd_rounding(429, 100)
    500
    >>> odd_rounding(790, 10)
    790
