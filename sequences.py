Problem:

    The function in_sequence takes in 3 inputs: a, b and t.

    If t is present in the sequence an + b, it prints which term it is in
    the sequence, otherwise it prints out "Not present".

    For example:

    in_sequence(3, 2, 14) is looking at the sequence 3n + 2.
    The terms in this sequence are: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ...
    14 is the 4th term in this sequence so the function would print out 4.

    in_sequence(7, -2, 25) is looking at the sequence 7n - 2.
    The terms in this sequence are 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, ....
    25 is not present in this sequence so the function would print "Not present"

Tests:

    >>> in_sequence(3, 2, 14)
    4
    >>> in_sequence(5, -3, 37)
    8
    >>> in_sequence(-2, 20, 28)
    Not present
    >>> in_sequence(6, 3, 23)
    Not present
    >>> in_sequence(-3, 100, 1)
    33
